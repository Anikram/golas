this is my first project in web-dev
Im going to make a web browser app - daily reminder. 
It will store, sort and manage goals, milestones, sub-goals, tasks.
There is a time-data section, list section (3 columns), menu section, calendar section.
The concept is that life is gonna be ballanced to pearson to feel good.
Its gonna be html5, css, javaS, jQerry and some data-base structures, which i now nothing about.
